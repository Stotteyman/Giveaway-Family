# Picking Winners

The last step of doing Giveaways is probably the most important part - THE WINNERS

Keep in mind that picking a Winner is a great Chance of getting to Chat with people and meet new friends. You are starting a conversation with a person on a positive basis and sometimes even make the day of that person. Giveaways are much more than just promotions and it´s all up to you what you make out of it!

As of now, there is no official tool to pick Winners in your Giveaways. However, most of the Community is using a Tool called [Twitterpicker](https://twitterpicker.com/) ([https://twitterpicker.com/](https://twitterpicker.com/)). It´s a very useful, free service to pick Winners and to make sure they did the required tasks (follow + retweet). Please be careful when navigating that website as there is many ads.

**PLEASE ALWAYS ANNOUNCE YOUR WINNERS PUBLICLY**\
****There is only benefits in posting the Winners publicly on your Twitter account. All your followers will see you are legit and people that win will reply to your message, which brings you even more visibility. Credibility and trust is very important in this anonymous space (ironically). Only your actions count, so make sure your actions are GOOD!
