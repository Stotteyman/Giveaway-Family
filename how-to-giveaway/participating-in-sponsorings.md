# Participating in Sponsorings

So you made it through the verification process of our administrators and are ready to get Sponsored from our Creators. In this little step by step guide, you learn what we expect from you when joining the Sponsored drops:

**Step 1 - Read the Announcement**\
****After a new Sponsor was introduced in the Announcement channel, you should carefully ready all details about the upcoming drop. Make sure to follow the Twitter account of the Sponsor and always ask questions if anything is unclear. Please always double check on the REQUIREMENTS for your Giveaway posts. Some Sponsors are more relaxed and only expect you to tag their Twitter in your Giveaway posts, while others provide several requirements (join discord, post screenshot, etc.). The TOP priority is to make the Sponsors happy, if you accidently tag the wrong account or ignored the requirements the Sponsors might be disappointed and not reach out to our Community anymore. Bad or lazy behaviour can damage our Community and the administrators will always watch on your activity, so please read carefully.

**Step 2 - Confirming Participation**\
****In the Announcement you will find the link to a specific Thread inside our discord. In order to participate in the Sponsoring, you must write your Ethereum address in the specific Thread. Please note that you are confirming to post at least one Giveaway with the sponsored Wearables and we regularly check on our members if they abide by the rules. If you confirm your participation, we expect a Giveaway from you.

**Step 3 - Waiting for the drop**\
****After you posted your address in the specified Channel, all you have to do is wait. Usually we wait 24 hours before sending out the first wave of Sponsored wearables. Additionally, we will provide another Announcement after the Wearables have been distributed. Please carefully read the second Announcement as well, to make sure you know what the Sponsor is expecting from you.

**Step 4 - Posting the Giveaway**\
****After you carefully read through the announcement and received your NFTs, you are ready to go post some Giveaways with them. We always try to send at least 2, so you can keep one for yourself (kind of a payment for you) and post a Giveaway with the other. MOST important is that you ALWAYS tag the Sponsors of the Wearables in your post and make sure the focus is on making them more visible.&#x20;

**Step 5 - Reporting**\
****After posting your Giveaway, itÂ´s highly recommended you post the Link to it in the "Giveaways" channel on discord. This way we can make sure to retweet your Giveaways and also you will receive bonus roles, enabling you to participate in even more limited drops!
