# Creating Giveaways

Creating a Giveaway Post seems easy and simple at first, but truly successful promoters know that every detail counts. Here are some suggestions on how you should prepare and post your Giveaways:

MOST important is that you ALWAYS tag the Sponsors of the Wearables in your posts and make sure the focus is on making them more visible. Don´t tag too many people as it might reduce your interaction rates!

Tasks like follow + retweet are usually default, we recommend you don´t use more than 3 tasks in total (for example Follow, Retweet, Comment). As a rule of thumb, few rules in the Giveaways leads to more people participating. However, you can use additional "hard" tasks like "make a screenshot" to reduce the amount of abusers and bots in the Giveaways.

We don´t expect you to design your own images and think of some catchy, short sentences yourself, but it is always highly appreciated if you use a screenshot of you wearing the NFTs ingame or use some image editing to make the pictures look more professional.&#x20;

Same goes for the wording, while it´s easy to copy paste from existing Giveaway posts, real successful Giveaways need some creativity and a unique touch.&#x20;

Generally, we always appreciate some creative approaches and Giveaways that differ from the default, don´t be afraid to try something new!

**What makes a good Giveaway post?**

* **Use VERY simple english and no shortcuts**\
  **(E.g. not everyone knows what "RT" means)**
* **Use NICE images, not only Opensea screenshots**\
  **(Sometimes just a cool image with no relation to the NFT can work)**
* **Interact with your followers**\
  **(A simple reply like "thanks for participating", makes the difference)**
* **Show some creativity and innovation**\
  **(DO NOT always copy paste the same post, bring some variation and try something new)**
* **Use linebreaks and emojis**\
  **(Don´t make it too hard for people to read)**
* **Keep the amount of tasks low**\
  **(Only follow and retweet works best)**
* **Get inspiration from others**\
