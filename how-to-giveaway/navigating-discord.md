# Navigating Discord

Your journey starts by receiving your first free NFTs from any administrator of our Community, who will also shortly explain you what you have to do.&#x20;

In order to fully navigate the Discord, you need to receive the "Giveaway Artist" role. Usually, this requires you to post your very first Giveaway for the Community. An administrator would send you some free NFTs to get started and explain you the first steps. As of now there are no specific requirements to post your first Giveaway and join the Community, this is just a verification step and we will not rate your first Giveaway.

After getting verified on the Discord you will see several new Channels, which have different functions:

**Announcements Channel** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line">****\
****Just as the name says, this is the most important Channel in the Discord. Keep an eye on upcoming Sponsorings here, some of them are highly limited and sometimes only the first people can get some, don´t slack!

**Giveaways Channel** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">\
After you have started your Giveaway, you can post the Link to it in the Giveaways Channel. While it´s optional to do so, we highly recommend it as you will receive the special "grinder" role, showcasing your effort and activity inside the Community and enabling further benefits. It also helps the admins to find out who is posting Giveaways honestly.

**Gift-Faucet Channel** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="" data-size="line">\
This is a very special Channel, accessible only for verified members. You can ask for more free NFTs in this channel ANYTIME you want. We usually send out the wearables once every couple of days to everyone that posted a Ethereum address in this channel. You will receive up to 70 NFTs (6 different pieces) of common rarity. The Sponsors of these wearables have provided minting permissions to us, which is why we are allowed to send you more whenever you need. However, since 70 NFTs is A LOT to Giveaway, please only ask for free Stuff here if you gave away all your NFTs already.
