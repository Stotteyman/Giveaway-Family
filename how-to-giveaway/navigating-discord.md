# Navigating Discord

Your journey starts by receiving your first free NFTs from any administrator of our Community, who will also shortly explain you what you have to do.&#x20;

In order to fully navigate the Discord, you need to receive the "Giveaway Artist" role. Usually, this requires you to post your very first Giveaway for the Community. An administrator would send you some free NFTs to get started and explain you the first steps. As of now there are no specific requirements to post your first Giveaway and join the Community, this is just a verification step and we will not rate your first Giveaway.

After getting verified on the Discord you will see several new Channels, which have different functions:

**Announcements Channel** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line">****\
****Just as the name says, this is the most important Channel in the Discord. Keep an eye on upcoming Sponsorings here, some of them are highly limited and sometimes only the first people can get some, donÂ´t slack!
